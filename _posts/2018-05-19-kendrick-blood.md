> So I was takin' a walk the other day  
> And I seen a woman—a blind woman  
> Pacin' up and down the sidewalk  
> She seemed to be a bit frustrated  
> As if she had dropped somethin' and  
> Havin' a hard time findin' it  
> So after watchin' her struggle for a while  
> I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?  
> "Hello ma'am, can I be of any assistance?  
> It seems to me that you have lost something  
> I would like to help you find it."  
> She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something  
> You've lost… your life."
