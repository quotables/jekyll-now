> As I and the Centre for Effective Altruism define it, **effective altruism is the project of using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis**.
> 
> On this definition, effective altruism is an **intellectual and practical project rather than a normative claim**, in the same way that science is an intellectual and practical project rather than a body of any particular normative and empirical claims. Its aims are **welfarist**, **impartial**, and **maximising**: effective altruists aim to maximise the wellbeing of all, where (on some interpretation) everyone counts for one, and no-one for more than one. But it is not a mere restatement of consequentialism: it does not claim that one is always obligated to maximise the good, impartially considered, with no room for one’s personal projects; and it does not claim that one is permitted to violate side-constraints for the greater good.
> 
> Effective altruism is an idea with a community built around it. **That community champions certain values that aren’t part of the definition of effective altruism per se**. These include serious commitment to benefiting others, with many members of the community pledging to donate at least 10% of their income to charity; scientific mindset, and willingness to change one’s mind in light of new evidence or argument; openness to many different cause-areas, such as extreme poverty, farm animal welfare, and risks of human extinction; integrity, with a strong commitment to honesty and transparency; and a collaborative spirit, with an unusual level of cooperation between people with different moral projects.
