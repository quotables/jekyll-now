> KING HENRY:
> 
> Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
> Or close the wall up with our English dead!
> In peace there’s nothing so becomes a man,
> As modest stillness and humility;
> But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
> Then imitate the action of the tiger:
> Stiffen the sinews, conjure up the blood,
> Disguise fair nature with hard-favoured rage:
> Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
> Let it pry through the portage of the head,
> Like the brass cannon; let the brow o’erwhelm it
> As fearfully as doth a galled rock
> O’erhang and jutty his confounded base,
> Swill’d with the wild and wasteful ocean.


William Shakespeare, _Henry V_, Act III, Scene I
