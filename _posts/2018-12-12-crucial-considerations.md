> So, “maximize expected value”, say, is a quantity we could define. It just doesn’t help us very much, because whenever you try to do
something specific you’re still virtually as far away as you had been. On the other hand, if you set some
more concrete objective, like maximize the number of people in this room, or something like that, we
can now easily tell like how many people there are, and we have ideas about how we could maximize it.
So any particular action we think of we might easily see how it fares on this objective of maximizing the
people in this room. However, we might feel it’s very difficult to get strong reasons for knowing whether
more people in this room is better, or whether there is some inverse relationship. A good signpost would
strike a reasonable compromise between being visible from afar and also being such that we can have
strong reason to be sure of its sign.
