> Flying is the worst one, because people come back from flights, and they tell you their story.... They’re like, “It was the worst day of my life.... We get on the plane and they made us sit there on the runway for forty minutes.”... Oh really, then what happened next? Did you _fly_ through the air, _incredibly_, like a bird? Did you soar into the clouds, impossibly? Did you partake in the miracle of human flight, and then land softly on giant tires that you couldn’t even conceive how they fuckin’ put air in them?
