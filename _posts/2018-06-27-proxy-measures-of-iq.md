> In the inspection-time task, a person looks at two vertical lines of unequal length and is asked to identify which of the two is longer. Inspection time is the length of time of stimulus presentation each individual needs in order to discriminate which of the two lines is the longest. Some research suggests that more-intelligent individuals are able to discriminate the lengths of the lines in shorter inspection times.

Robert J.Sternberg, Encyclopædia Britannica, _Intelligence_

> This study replicated and extended Kranzler and Jensen's [Intelligence 13 (1989) 329] meta-analysis of the relationship between inspection time (IT) and intelligence (IQ). [...] meta-analyses were conducted on obtained correlations (r's) between IT and general IQ. [...] For the total sample (N>4100), the r was −.51 after correction for artifactual effects (−.30 prior to correction).
