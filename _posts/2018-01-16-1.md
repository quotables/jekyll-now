> Grilled Spanish mackerel sits in warm ponzu next to plums and “yolk jam”—a wonderfully pure, almost solid egg yolk, the texture attained, according to a server, by “cooking the yolk over low heat for a very long time.” Perfect little agnolotti ooze Fontina cheese and carrot butter; Proechel adds tender braised lamb neck and a dice of pickled squash and raw carrot to take it over the top.
