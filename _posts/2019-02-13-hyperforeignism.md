> A **hyperforeignism** is a type of qualitative hypercorrection that involves speakers misidentifying the distribution of a pattern found in loanwords and extending it to other environments, including words and phrases not borrowed from the language that the pattern derives from. The result of this process does not reflect the rules of either language. For example, _habanero_ is sometimes pronounced as though it were spelled with an \<ñ\> (_habañero_), which is not the Spanish form from which the English word was borrowed. [...]

> A number of words of French origin feature a final \<e\> that is pronounced in English but silent in the original language. For example, _forte_ (used to mean "strength" in English as in "not my _forte_") is often pronounced /ˈfɔːrteɪ/ or /fɔːrˈteɪ/, by confusion with the Italian musical term of the same spelling (and same Latin origin, but meaning "loud"), which is pronounced [ˈfɔrte]. In French, the word "forte" is pronounced [fɔʁt], with silent final \<e\> [...].
