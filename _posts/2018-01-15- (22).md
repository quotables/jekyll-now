<blockquote><p>As I say, then, cookery is flattery disguised as medicine; and cosmetics is disguised as gymnastics in the same way &#8211; crooked, deceptive, mean, slavish, deceiving by shaping, colouring, smoothing, dressing, making people assume a beauty which is not their own, and neglecting the beauty of their own which would come through gymnastics. [&#8230;] As cosmetics is to gymnastics, so is sophistry to legislation, and as cookery is to medicine, so is rhetoric to justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plato, <em>Gorgias</em> 465b</p>
