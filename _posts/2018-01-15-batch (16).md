<blockquote><p>The rhetor doesn&#8217;t know the things themselves, what is good or bad, what is fine or shameful or just or unjust, but has devised persuasion about them so that though he doesn&#8217;t know, among those who don&#8217;t know he appears to know.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plato,<em> Gorgias </em>459d</p>
