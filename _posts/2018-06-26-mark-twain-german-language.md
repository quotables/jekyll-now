> ADDRESS TO THE VIENNA PRESS CLUB, NOVEMBER 21, 1897,
> DELIVERED IN GERMAN [Here in literal translation] [...]

> I am indeed the truest friend of the German language--and not only now, but from long since--yes, before twenty years already. [...] I would only some changes effect. I would only the language method--the luxurious, elaborate construction compress, the eternal parenthesis suppress, do away with, annihilate; the introduction of more than thirteen subjects in one sentence forbid; the verb so far to the front pull that one it without a telescope discover can.  [...] I might gladly the separable verb also a little bit reform.  I might none do let what Schiller did: he has the whole history of the Thirty Years' War between the two members of a separable verb in-pushed.  That has even Germany itself aroused, and one has Schiller the permission refused the History of the Hundred Years' War to composeâ€”God be it thanked!
